# Music-Downloader
A script to automate the proccess of converting and downloading songs from youtube playlist

# How to use
Run the main.pyw file, then choose the destination folder where you would like the music to be downloaded and paste the playlist url
# Frameworks/Libraries used

* Selenium for automating the downloading proccess and extracting the urls from playlist (since it loads dynamically). Chrome drivers are used so you need to install the appropriate version
* PyQt5 for the GUI (The .UI file is also included if you want to use it)

# Disclaimer:
The site used is just the first I found when looking for a youtube to mp3 converter. It has worked well in all my testing, without any problems or suspicious activity.
The script just automates the proccess, so the dangers (if any) remain the same as using a site manually
